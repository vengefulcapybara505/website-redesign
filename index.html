            <h2>What Is Therapeutic Massage?<br><br></h2>
            <p>Therapeutic massage involves the manipulation of the body's soft tissue. This can be accomplished through the use of pressure, 
                vibration, or tension and is generally accomplished manually.  Tissues that can be targeted with massage 
                include muscles, ligaments, skin, connective tissue, as well as lymphatic vessels.
                <br><br>
                At Waters Natural Therapeutics, I specialize in deep tissue massage. Deep tissue massage focuses on the muscles 
                located below the surface of the top muscles. This type of therapeutic massage is often recommended for individuals 
                who experience consistent pain as a result of heavy physical activity, such as athletes, or clients who have sustained physical trauma.  
                Repetitive motion can also cause adhesions to the deeper muscles 
                causing restricted range of motion. Deep tissue bodywork helps to bring the muscle back to its natural way of working.
                <br><br>
                In addition to standard deep tissue therapeutic massage, I also offer massage that focuses on the relief of 
                pain related to the TMJ (temporomandibular joint). TMJ pain is commonly caused by myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome, 
                primarily involving the muscles of mastication, otherwise known as your chewing muscles. 
                Many dentists recommend deep tissue massage for relief of TMJ pain. This involves massage of the facial, neck, 
                and shoulder muscles. <br><br><br><br>

                My name is Wendy Waters and I've been licensed as a massage therapist since 1994. 
                I was originally trained in Mesa, Arizona at the Institute for Natural Therapeutics.  
                I've practiced in Albuquerque since 2000. Having spent time in the airline and real estate business, 
                I really appreciate having the opportunity to work with people on a more personal level. 
                It brings me great joy to be able to help people relax and pursue a healthy life style.
