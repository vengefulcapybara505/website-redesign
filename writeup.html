            <p class = "intro">The goal of this assignment was to practice the workflow of redesigning a simple website. 
                We learned the skills necessary to analyze and identify flaws in an existing interface, create low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes 
                for various screen sizes, and build a responsive website based on those prototypes.
                <br>
                <br>
                We first started off by picking a website to redesign. I picked a website for a massage studio. It was very outdated looking
                 and had a poor layout. It did not work well on small screen sizes and I found that it was very irritating to try and 
                 complete any simple tasks on the interface. The redesign needed to clearly articulate information about the practice such 
                 as location, contact email, phone, and an intro to the practitioner. It needs to be an entry point for patients to learn more
                 about the practice and also find necessary resources.
                 Improving its compatability with smaller screens was my top priority.
                 However, there were obvious flaws that could also be corrected. <br><br>

            </div>

            <p>I analyzed the usability of the webpage using the criteria of: <br><br></p>
            <ul class = "criteria">
                    
                <li>
                    Usability
                </li>
                <li>Learnability</li>
                <li>Memorability</li>
                <li>Accessibility</li>
            </ul>

            <p><br><br>The problems I found are as follows: <br><br></p>
           
            <div>
                

                
                <h3>Usability: (how easy is it for the user to do common tasks?)</h3><p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Logo and pictures are cut off on small screen size.
                </li>
                <li>Font is sometimes hard to read and small.</li>
                <li>Text is dense.</li>
                <li>Drop down menu doesn't let you select options as it redirects every time you click it.</li>
                <li>A few links exist that link to themselves.</li>
                <li>Important info about the current state of the practice should be more obvious. It is easily glossed over</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                Learnability: (how easy it for users to do simple tasks on their first time using the interface?)
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Links do not appear to be links and you sort of accidentally click them.</li>
                <li>About page should have more contact details.</li>
                <li>Drop down menu doesn't show all the available treatment options</li>
                <li>It's hard to find the owner's blog on the pages.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                Memorability (how easy is it for users to do tasks once they have learned the design?):
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It might be hard to find contact details as they are sporadically placed around the page</li>
                <li>It's hard to find her blog on specific procedures on the pages. You have to go through many links</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                Accessibility (What tools are available for handicapped users?): 
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There are no alt tags for the images.</li>
                <li>There are a few empty headers that might confuse users.</li>
                <li>Heading level is skipped from h1 to h3. The navigation menu contains redundant title text.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
                Using the observations from the above, I created a basic wireframe for a more robust and well-designed website that 
                addresses the problems above. A wireframe is a two-dimensional illustration of a page's interface 
                that specifically focuses on space allocation and prioritization of 
                content, functionalities available, and intended behaviors. Below is are the images of my wireframes. There are 3 for each type of device. 
                They contain annotations that address the usability issues with the original site.<br><br>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
                Using the wireframes. I created a high fidelity prototype using figma. 
                High-fidelity prototypes are prototypes that allow user interactions. High-fidelity
                prototypes take you as close as possible to a true representation of the user interface. The style guide sets
                guidelines for the the color scheme and general aesthetic appearance. Again there are 3 sizes of frames 
                representative of the different device types. Below are the the style guide and the 3 prototypes.  <br><br>

            <p style="text-align: left">
                Using the wireframe and high fidelity prototypes, I then created an interactive webpage from HTML and CSS that captures my vision
                of what the new website should look like. I focused on making it responsive to varying screen sizes and create
                a simple and intuitive layout. Compared to the original site, it should be easier to navigate, find information quickly, and 
                work better on varying screen sizes. Below are the links the original and the redesigned version. <br><br>

            <h2><br><br><br><br> Conclusion <br><br></h2>
            <p style="text-align: left">
                This project was a fantastic exercise to practice redesigning an existing interface. I was able to practice all the 
                stages of development including research, wireframing, hi-fi prototyping, and final product development. I found that it
                is not always apparent on how to immediately improve a design besides from the pure aesthetic. You have to place yourself
                in the shoes of a potential user and think about what their needs are. I also enjoyed making the final design responsive
                so it was easy to use on a pc, laptop, tablet, and phone screen sizes. It showed me how valuable flexboxes and relative
                sizing are. Overall, I learned a lot about web design and how to build something from the ground up.
