            <p class = "intro">The goal of this assignment was to practive the workflow of redesigning a simple website. 
                We took away the skills necessary to analyze and identify flaws in an existing interface, create low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes 
                for various screen sizes, and build a responsive website based on those prototypes.
                <br>
                <br>
                We first started off by picking a website to redesign. I picked a website for a massage studio. It was very outdated looking
                 and had a poor layout. There were obvious flaws that could be corrected.

            <div class = "img_div" >
                <img src="images/watersmassage.png" alt="A screenshot of my selected website">
            </div>

            <p>I analyzed the usability of the webpage using the criteria of: <br><br></p>
            <ul class = "criteria">
                    
                <li>
                    Usability
                </li>
                <li>Learnability</li>
                <li>Memorability</li>
                <li>Accessibility</li>
            </ul>

            <p><br><br>The problems I found are as follows: <br><br></p>
           
            <div>
                

                
                <h3>Usability:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Logo and pictures are cut off on small screen
                </li>
                <li>Font is sometimes hard to read and small.</li>
                <li>Drop down menu doesn't let you select options as it redirects every time you click it.</li>
                <li>A few links that link to themselves.</li>
                <li>Important info about the current state of the practice should be more obvious.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                Learnability:
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Links do not appear to be links and you sort of accidentally click them.</li>
                <li>Text is dense.</li>
                <li>About page should have more contact details.</li>
                <li>Drop down menu doesn't show all the treatment options</li>
                <li>It's hard to find her blog on the pages.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                Memorability:
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It might be hard to find contact details as they are sporadically placed around the page</li>
                <li>It's hard to find her blog on specific procedures on the pages.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                Accessibility: 
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There are no alt tags for the images.</li>
                <li>There are a few empty headers that might confuse users.</li>
                <li>Heading level is skipped from h1 to h3. The navigation menu contains redundant title text.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Low Fidelity Prototype <br><br></h2>
            <p>
                Using the observations from the above, I created a basic wireframe for a more robust and well-designed website that 
                addresses the problems above. Below is are the images of my wireframes. There are 3 for each type of device. <br><br>

            <h2>Visual Design Guide and High Fidelity Prototype <br><br></h2>
            <p>
                Using the wireframes. I created a high fidelity prototype using figma. Again there are 3 sizes of frames 
                representative of the different device types. Below are the links to the 3 prototypes. <br><br>

            <p>
                Using the wireframe and high fidelity prototypes, I then created an interactive webpage from HTML and CSS that captures my vision
                of what the new website should look like. Below is the original and the redesigned version. <br><br>
